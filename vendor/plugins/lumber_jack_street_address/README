Please read 'about_lumber_jack' for more background on this project.

LumberJack::StreetAddress
=====================
This plugin installs a polymorphic StreetAddress model into your application.
After it is installed, you will be able to associate multiple StreetAddresses with any model in your application. You will also have a polymorphic 
controller and views to re-use on all of your associated models.

In addition to associating several StreetAddresses with your Model, you will 
also gain some helper methods to manage Model and StreetAddresses. 

We use the GeoKit gem for GeoCoding capabilities. Install it with 'sudo gem 
install geokit'

Here is a brief example:

organization.rb:
---------------
  class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many_street_addresses
  end

Your Person model now has the usual 'has_many' functionality plus some
additional methods:

  Person.find_all_by_street_address('address') => array of Person models for 
    that 'address'.

  p = Person.find(1)
  p.street_address_for('purpose') => The street_address object for that 
    'purpose'.
  p.street_address_for_purpose => The same thing called differently
  p.street_address_for('purpose').display_string => '123 Main St, Anytown, AA 12345'
  p.street_address_for_purpose.display_string => '123 Main St, Anytown, AA 12345'
  p.street_address_best => The street_address object that you have sorted to 
    the top of the list.

routes.rb:
---------
  map.resources :people, :has_many => :street_addresses

Your PeopleController now has access to the polymorphic 
StreetAddressesController and the views required to manage StreetAddresses for 
people.

Plugin Installation for a brand new project:
===========================================
0)  Rails 2.3.2 or higher, SQLite3, & GeoKit gem ('sudo gem install geokit')
1)  Create a new rails project: 'rails test_street_address'
2)  Move into your new directory
3)  'script/generate scaffold Organization name:string'
4)  'script/generate scaffold Person name:string'
5)  'script/plugin install acts_as_list'
6)  Install LumberJack:
    'script/plugin install 
    git://github.com/brianlong/lumber_jack_street_address.git'
7)  'script/generate lumber_jack_street_address'
8)  add this to 'app/models/organization.rb' & 'app/models/people.rb'
      has_many_street_addresses #(Put it right after the class definition)
9)  Move 'views/layouts/organizations.html.erb' to
      'views/layouts/application.html.erb'
      (Not sure why Rails does not create this file)
10) Delete 'views/layouts/organizations.html.erb'
      & 'views/layouts/people.html.erb'
11)  Modify 'views/layouts/application.html.erb' to include this in the

        <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'scaffold', 'lumber_jack' %>
        <%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %>
12)  Modify 'config/routes.rb' as follows:
      map.resources :organizations, :has_many => :street_addresses
      map.resources :people, :has_many => :street_addresses
      map.root :controller => "organizations"
13) Delete 'public/index.html'
14) Add this partial reference to 'app/views/organizations/show.html.erb':
    <%= render :partial => 'street_addresses/list',
      :locals => {:telephonic => @organization} %>
15) Add this partial reference to 'app/views/people/show.html.erb':
    <%= render :partial => 'street_addresses/list',
      :locals => {:telephonic => @person} %>
16) rake db:create
17) rake db:migrate
18) Add your GeoKit API Keys to 'config/initializers/geokit_config.rb'
19) script/server
20) Create an Organization and a Person then add some street addresses for 
    each
21) Use script/console to check out some methods that the plugin adds to your
    models:
    
  Model.find_all_by_street_address('address') => array of Models for that   
    number
  m = Model.find(1)
  p.street_address_for('purpose') => The street_address object for that 
    'purpose'.
  p.street_address_for_purpose => The same thing called differently
  p.street_address_for('purpose').display_string => '123 Main St, Anytown, AnyState 
    12345'
  p.street_address_for_purpose => '123 Main St, Anytown, AnyState 12345'
  m.street_address_best => The street_address object that you have sorted to 
    the top of the list.
