LumberJack::InternetAddress
=====================
This plugin installs a polymorphic InternetAddress model into your application.
After it is installed, you will be able to associate multiple InternetAddresss with
any model in your application. You will also have a polymorphic controller and
views to re-use on all of your associated models.

In addition to associating several InternetAddresss with your Model, you will also
gain some helper methods to manage Model and InternetAddresss. Here is a brief
example:

organization.rb:
---------------
  class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many_internet_addresses
  end

Your Person model now has the usual 'has_many' functionality plus some
additional methods:

  Person.find_all_by_internet_address('address') => array of Person models for that
  'address'.
  p = Person.find(1)
  p.internet_address_for('purpose') => The internet_address object for that 'purpose'.
  p.internet_address_for_purpose => The same thing called differently
  p.internet_address_for('purpose').to_s => 'http://www.economics.com' # A formatted string.
  p.internet_address_for_purpose.to_s => 'http://www.economics.com' # A formatted string.
  m.internet_address_best => The internet_address object that you have sorted to the top of the list.

routes.rb:
---------
  map.resources :people, :has_many => :internet_addresses

Your PeopleController now has access to the polymorphic InternetAddresssController
and the views required to manage InternetAddresss for people.

Plugin Installation for a brand new project:
===========================================
0)  Rails 2.3.2 or higher & SQLite3!
1)  Create a new rails project: 'rails test_internet_address'
2)  Move into your new directory
3)  'script/generate scaffold Organization name:string'
4)  'script/generate scaffold Person name:string'
5)  'script/plugin install acts_as_list'
6)  Install LumberJack:
    'script/plugin install git://github.com/brianlong/lumber_jack_internet_address.git'
7)  'script/generate lumber_jack_internet_address'
8)  add this to 'app/models/organization.rb' & 'app/models/people.rb'
      has_many_internet_addresses #(Put it right after the class definition)
9)  Move 'views/layouts/organizations.html.erb' to
      'views/layouts/application.html.erb'
      (Not sure why Rails does not create this file)
10) Delete 'views/layouts/organizations.html.erb'
      & 'views/layouts/people.html.erb'
11)  Modify 'views/layouts/application.html.erb' to include this in the

        <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'scaffold', 'lumber_jack' %>
        <%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %>
12)  Modify 'config/routes.rb' as follows:
      map.resources :organizations, :has_many => :internet_addresses
      map.resources :people, :has_many => :internet_addresses
      map.root :controller => "organizations"
13) Delete 'public/index.html'
14) Add this partial reference to 'app/views/organizations/show.html.erb':
    <%= render :partial => 'internet_addresses/list',
      :locals => {:locatable => @organization} %>
15) Add this partial reference to 'app/views/people/show.html.erb':
    <%= render :partial => 'internet_addresses/list',
      :locals => {:locatable => @person} %>
16) rake db:create
17) rake db:migrate
18) script/server
19) Create an Organization and a Person then add some web addresses for each
20) Use script/console to check out some methods that the plugin adds to your
    models:
  Model.find_all_by_internet_address('address') => array of Models for that address
  m = Model.find(1)
  p.internet_address_for('purpose') => The internet_address object for that 'purpose'.
  p.internet_address_for_purpose => The same thing called differently
  p.internet_address_for('purpose').to_s => 'http://www.economics.com' # A formatted string.
  p.internet_address_for_purpose => 'http://www.economics.com' # A formatted string.
  m.internet_address_best => The internet_address object that you have sorted to the top of the list.
