About LumberJack
================
I am most interested in the business layer that 'sits on top of rails.' This
goal of this project is to create a reusable library of business objects for
use in any project. For example, how many times have you created telephones,
street addresses, e-mail addresses, orders, line items, etc. for a new
project? It makes sense to encapsulate this business logic into reusable
models for use on future projects.

Please help! Please share any business logic that you think will help
enhance the models in this library. Any business logic will help -- especially
when it comes to internationalization.

Why the name 'LumberJack'?
==========================
I grew up in the Minnesota north woods where legend spoke of the giant
lumberjack Paul Bunyan and Babe his big blue ox. The legend says that Paul was
so large at birth that it required three storks to carry him to his house. As
school children, we learned that Minnesota's 10,000 lakes were created by
Paul's footprints filled-up with rain. Also, His axe was so large that he
could fell several trees in a single swing. Paul's skill with an axe, of
course, made him the original 'hacker' and a fitting namesake for this
project.

Also see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bunyan for more stories and photos
about Paul.
