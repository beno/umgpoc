= Nested Form

A Rails gem to conveniently manage multiple nested models in a single form. It does so in an unobtrusive way through jQuery or Prototype.

This gem only works with Rails 3. See the <tt>rails2</tt> branch for a plugin to work in Rails 2.


== Setup

Add it to your Gemfile then run +bundle+ to install it.
  
  gem "nested_form"

Next run the generator to create the JavaScript file.

  rails generate nested_form:install

Running the generator will add a file at <tt>public/javascripts/nested_form.js</tt> which should be included after the jQuery or Prototype framework.

  <%= javascript_include_tag :defaults, "nested_form" %>


== Usage

Use the +nested_form_for+ helper method to enable the nesting.

  <%= nested_form_for @project do |f| %>

Use this form just like normal, including the +fields_for+ helper method for nesting models. The benefit of this plugin comes from the +link_to_add+ and +link_to_remove+ helper methods on the form builder.

  <%= f.fields_for :tasks do |task_form| %>
    <%= task_form.text_field :name %>
    <%= task_form.link_to_remove "Remove this task" %>
  <% end %>
  <p><%= f.link_to_add "Add a task", :tasks %></p>

This generates links which dynamically add and remove fields.


== Partials

This feature is still in development and not yet working.

It is often desirable to move the nested fields into a partial to keep things organized. If you don't supply a block to fields_for it will look for a partial and use that.

  <%= f.fields_for :tasks %>

In this case it will look for a partial called "task_fields" and pass the form builder as an f variable to it.


== Special Thanks

This gem was originally based on the solution by Tim Riley in his {complex-form-examples fork}[https://github.com/timriley/complex-form-examples/tree/unobtrusive-jquery-deep-fix2].

Thank you Andrew Manshin for the Rails 3 transition, {Andrea Singh}[https://github.com/madebydna] for converting to a gem and {Peter Giacomo Lombardo}[https://github.com/pglombardo] for Prototype support.

Andrea also wrote a great {blog post}[http://blog.madebydna.com/all/code/2010/10/07/dynamic-nested-froms-with-the-nested-form-gem.html] on the internal workings of this gem.
